### 🩺 Skin Disease Classification Web Application

This project is a **Django-based web application** for **skin disease classification**.
Users can upload an image of a skin lesion, and the system automatically classifies the disease using deep learning models.

#### 🔍 Project Overview

* **Frontend & Backend:** Built with Django framework.
* **Image Preprocessing:** Includes **hair removal** and **image segmentation** to enhance classification accuracy.
* **Model Training:** Implemented and compared three convolutional neural network architectures:

  * **CNN (Custom model)**
  * **VGG**
  * **ResNet-50**
* **Evaluation:** The performance and results of each model were analyzed and compared to identify the best-performing architecture.

#### ⚙️ Features

* Upload skin lesion images directly from the browser.
* Automatic preprocessing before classification.
* Display of model predictions and confidence scores.
* Comparison of model accuracy and performance metrics.

#### 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Python**, **Django**, **TensorFlow / Keras**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
